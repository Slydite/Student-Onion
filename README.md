Use this app to login into BITS-STUDENT networks easier, view **~~redacted~~** and **~~redacted~~** and more.

Currently the app is in Alpha, only wifi login is available, more will be out soon.


(Note that this app is completely unrelated to the Student Union(completely unrelated) or the Coding club(which I am a part of). This is just a personal project for learning.)
